   "FrackinUniverse adds a great number of additional status effects. This short guide should help to sort them out for you. Click next page to continue.",
   "Tile Effects:  Some tiles give buffs or debuffs when stepped on. Many of these will not give indicators, but will affect your movement. Snow, mud, jungle dirt and clay are some examples of this in action. Asphalt increases your ground speed, which is useful in bases. Experiment, and you might find some really useful stuff.",
   "Temperature: Cold, Heat and Radiation are things from ordinary Starbound. Frackin' Universe adds its own tiers of these in the form of ^orange;Deadly Cold, Deadly Heat and Deadly Radiation^reset;. To survive these hazards you'll need special gear (this gear usually displays the immunity) such as Mutavisk Armor for Deadly Radiation. ",
   "Proto Poison: This nasty effect is a threat on Proto Worlds. It will slowly sap your maximum health and *will* eventually kill you. Seek out proto-poison protection from various gear in your lab stations. Augments are always an option.",
   "Acid: You don't want to take a dip in sulphuric acid. It's not good for your long-term survival goals. Instead, protect yourself with a layer of Acid Protection. Many suits of armor provide this, as well as augments you can craft in your nanofabricator.",
   "Insanity: A constant degradation of your mental state, insanity saps your ability to protect yourself over a sustained period by draining your Protection. Additionally, it gives a mild bit of damage per tick. Augments and armor exist to combat this nasty effect. You'll find this effect on Atropus biomes.",
   "Note that there are many other effects you can be affected by in your exploration of the universe. Not all of them can be resisted, and some might be resisted by surprising things. Just stay aware...and stay safe."
